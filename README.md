Project Proposal:
Our project is to build a convolutional neural network using keras. Our data which is composed of hashcodes of malware files, API calls from PEFile library in Python, and the malware type from the VirusTotal API, in CSV format. One of these datasets contains 9,795 samples obtained and compiled from VirusSamples, and the other contains 14,616 samples from VirusShare. 

VirusSample dataset includes the malware families of Adware, Agent, Backdoor, Trojan, Virus, Worms, Downloader, Spyware, Ransomware, Riskware, Dropper, Crypt, Keylogger. 

VirusShare dataset includes families of Adware, Agent, Backdoor, Downloader, Ransomware, Riskware, Trojan, Virus, Worms, Undefined, Spyware, Dropper, Crypt, Keylogger, Rootkit.
